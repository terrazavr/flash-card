## Learn English with Flashcards

The program helps users learn the most popular and usable words in the English language. There is a simple GUI interface:

 - On one side of the card, you can see the word, its transcription, and listen to the pronunciation.
- After 3 seconds, the card will flip to the side with the translation in Russian.


The interface includes two buttons:

- ✅ - You know the word.
- ❌ - You don't know the word.

If you press the ✅ button, the word will be removed from the learn-list and will not be shown again.
